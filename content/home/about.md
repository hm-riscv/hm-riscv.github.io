RISC-V @ HM is a team at the [Faculty of Computer Science and
Mathematics](https://cs.hm.edu/) at [Munich University of Applied
Sciences](https://hm.edu/en). Our faculty has a long history of educating open
instruction sets with our previous [MMIX](http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/) and [Virtual
Motherboard](http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/vmb/index.html) activities.

We are introducing RISC-V in our coursework and research activities and share
our tools and materials here.
