title: VS Code Simulator Plugin

In our basic education in computer organization and computer architecture we use
the RISC-V instruction set architecture to teach the fundamentals of machine
programming. We want to make it as accessible as possible for our students to
use a programming environment, without fiddling with cross-compilers. The [Venus
simulator](https://venus.cs61c.org/) is a nice browser-based simulator that we
have used a lot. But we wanted to provide it in an established IDE running
locally on the students computers and thereby decided to integrate the Venus
simulator into Visual Studio Code, as a standalone extension.

You can find the extension on the [VS Code
marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hm.riscv-venus),
in VS Code directly or on
[Github](https://github.com/hm-riscv/vscode-riscv-venus).
