title: VS Code Venus RISC-V extension 1.0.0 released
---

We have released the first public stable version of our VS Code extension that
is based on the RISC-V extension. You only need this extension and no further
tools to get started with learning RISC-V assembly. You can find the extension
on the [VS Code
marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hm.riscv-venus),
in VS Code directly or on
[Github](https://github.com/hm-riscv/vscode-riscv-venus).
